By Jameson Chauluka: Malawi is likely to experience more floods in the next few days, especially in the flood-prone areas of the Southern Region, the Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services has warned.“The anticipated heavy rains could cause floods, including flush floods in prone areas. Therefore, to secure lives and property, the public should take precautionary measures such as moving to higher grounds when water levels start rising, avoid crossing flooding rivers and not seeking shelter under trees and weak structures,” reads a statement from the department.The statement says the adverse weather conditions are due to deep and wide low pressure systems in the Mozambican channel that has been strengthened some 390 kilometers North of the Southern border of Malawi and Mozambique in Nsanje District.It says, because of the storm, from Monday to today, heavy rains, accompanied by strong winds, are expected mainly in the Southern Region.“By 14:00 hours on Monday January 21st, the tropical storm was on its way to make a landfall over Mozambique, while dumping heavy rains overland including [in] Southern Malawi,” the statement reads in part.So far, 21 people have died due to natural disasters in the last six months in Malawi, with most of the deaths being due to lightning, which the department linked to deforestation.Severe weather conditions are, however, expected to weaken later this week in the Southern Region.A vibrant writer who gives a great insight on hot topics and issues12,000 childbirths expected in camps. By Feston Malekezo:Some 12,000 babies are expected to be born from 230,000 women who are living in designated camps hosting floods victims in the country, Department of Disaster Management Affairs (Dodma) and United Nations joint report says.The report released on Sunday warns that the women face challenges to access health centres and district hospitals, with one maternal death reported so far.“Based on the number of people affected, UNFPA estimates 23,000 women of childbearing age and about 12,000 expected deliveries.“Pregnant women are delivering in the camps with unskilled birth attendants. Four complicated cases have, so far, been reported. Health facilities are far from each other and the flooded roads are impassable to access health care services.United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is working with district health offices to distribute condoms to the camps.“UNFPA is also working with the Ministry of Health and Population- Reproductive Health Directorate to facilitate a comprehensive assessment of the capacity of health facilities to provide safe deliveries. This assessment will start as early as next week,” the report reads in part.The report says health workers have also been displaced, creating a situation of non-availability of staff to provide services.Apparently, the report says disease surveillance was strengthened by training 300 health workers out of the targeted 600 deployed to Phalombe, Balaka, Blantyre, Machinga, Mangochi and Chikwawa districts.Ministry of Health has, so far, distributed 107,500 mosquito nets to the camps from the surplus of the 2018 Mass Net Distribution Campaign.At least 15 districts were affected by the floods rendering about 868,895 destitute and 173 camps have been created to house the victims.A vibrant writer who gives a great insight on hot topics and issuesExpect more floods—Met. By Jameson Chauluka & Pilirani Kachinziri: Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services has warned of another heavy downpour in the Southern Region starting from Thursday, amid reports that the death toll from the recent floods has risen from 30 to 45.A statement from the department says the downpour follows development of Tropical Cyclone Idai in neighbouring Mozambique.“A deep and wide low pressure system in the Mozambique Channel developed into a Tropical Cyclone named ‘Idai’ on 11 March 2019 at a distance of 900 kilometres from southern Malawi border in Nsanje at position 17.4o South and 43.2o East approximately west-north of Madagascar,” the statement reads in part.The statement says the cyclone is expected to make a landfall over Beira in Mozambique, 480 kilometres to Nsanje Boma by Thursday, while dumping heavy rains overland in Mozambique and southern Malawi.“The anticipated heavy rains and strong winds are expected starting from Thursday 14th March to Sunday 17th March 2019 mainly over southern areas of Malawi which are at risk for [sic] locally damaging winds, flooding and significant travel disruptions as the Tropical Cyclone makes its way to Zimbabwe where it is expected to weaken and die on 18th March 2019,” it reads.The statement says, to secure property and lives, the public should move to higher grounds when water levels have started rising, avoid crossing flooding rivers and not seek shelter under trees and weak infrastructures.Meanwhile, the death toll from floods caused by heavy downpour which happened last week has risen from 30 to 45, with 577 people injured, Department of Disaster Management Affairs (Dodma) has announced.“A total of 147,958 households (approximately 739,790 people) have been affected and 15,185 households have been displaced. Most of the displaced families are living in camps and their relations’ houses. So far, a total of 187 camps have been established in the affected districts,” reads Dodma’s official facebook page Tuesday.Dodma spokesperson, Chipiliro Khamula, said they have distributed relief items to all the hard-to-reach areas affected by floods, especially in Lower Shire districts of Nsanje and Chikwawa.Nsanje District Commissioner, Reinghard Chavula, on Monday said many houses have collapsed and two deaths were reported in Makhanga area.“We have received a lot of support in form of food, blankets, plastic sheets and pales. We are thankful to the government,” she said.Village Head Kalonga recalled that such devastating floods occurred in 2015 but her subjects could not move upland because the government has not allocated them a proper land for resettlement.“People just talk…No , the government has not allocated us resettlement place (up land). But we need to protect the lives of these children,” he said.United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) has also provided assistance to the affected areas, ensuring that primary and secondary school classes resume in areas affected by the floods.In a press release issued on March 11 2019, Unicef Public Relations Officer, Rebecca Phwitiko, says they would provide tents and school supplies to schools and temporary learning centres and deploy additional volunteer teachers to the affected areas.“With thousands forced out of their flooded homes, many families lack basic supplies including food, water and sanitation facilities. The floods have also disrupted learning for thousands of children,” Phwitiko says.A vibrant writer who gives a great insight on hot topics and issuesFloods threaten food security—Fao. By Feston Malekezo:The food security situation is expected to worsen due to floods in the Southern Region which produces about one-third of Malawi’s maize output, Food and Agriculture Organisation’s (Fao) food security snapshot warns.The report, published on Monday, indicates that although there is no official data regarding the impact of the floods on the agriculture sector, crop losses are expected in the worst affected areas.Production of maize, Malawi’s main food staple, was forecast to increase to above average of about 3.3 million tonnes in 2019.The principal factor that supported the favourable production outlook is beneficial rainfall since the start of the cropping season in October 2018.“The recent floods in the Southern Region, which have affected over 900,000 people, have further compounded the situation. Losses of food supplies, damages to the soon-to-be harvested 2019 crops and reduced access to markets are likely to aggravate food security conditions.“Heavy rainfall, forecast for much of the second half of March, could increase the risk of further flooding, potentially resulting in larger crop losses and interruptions to humanitarian operations,” the report reads in part.The report says in the Central and Northern districts, there is a likelihood of an increase in cereal production, which is expected to foster improvements in food security in 2019 compared to 2018.“Following a tight maize supply situation in the 2018/19 marketing year, April and March, due to a sharply reduced harvest, prospects for 2019/20 are more favourable resting on the likely increase in production. The forecast supply upturn is expected to enable a build-up in stocks for both households and national strategic reserves, while import requirements are foreseen to fall and remain at below average levels,” the short report reads further.According to Fao, prices of maize increased steeply since the last quarter of 2018, with seasonal trends exacerbated by a tighter-than-normal supply situation.As a result, prices of maize in January 2019 were more than one-third above their year-earlier levels and, in areas such as, Mzuzu, doubled.“In the southern districts, the recent impact of the floods could result in temporary price spikes, due to disruptions to the food supply chain. Looking further ahead, if the above average production in 2019 occurs, maize prices are expected to come under downward pressure in 2019 following the main harvest that is expected to begin late April,” the reports notes.Irrigation and Water Development Ministry spokesperson, Hamilton Chimala, Tuesday said no Malawian would die of hunger as promised by President Peter Mutharika.“We shall be releasing a statement next week. Currently, we are consolidating effects of the flooding and incessant rainfall on crop stand, livestock, infrastructure, fisheries, among others. So, we are going to provide steps which the government will take to address the emerging gaps,” he said.A vibrant writer who gives a great insight on hot topics and issuesHouse collapses, 2 people die. By Yohane Symon: Two people died in Mangochi District after a wall of the house they were sleeping in collapsed due to heavy rains on Saturday night.Mangochi District Commissioner, Moses Chimphepo identified the victims as 53-year-old Patuma Welemu and her six-year-old granddaughter, Rose Ayami, both from Msinje Village, Traditional Authority Mponda.The death of the two has brought to 19 the number of people that have died due to natural disasters since the start of the rain season in November 2018.“It is true that we received a report and [we] went there to verify what had happened. Local authorities explained that the two were sleeping in their house and, due to heavy rains, one of the walls collapsed on them and they died on the spot,” Chimphepo said.Postmortem conducted at Koche Health Centre indicates that the two died due to injuries.Chimphepo said the government has provided support to the deceased’s relatives to help them with burial arrangements.Minister of Homeland Security, Nicholas Dausi, who is also responsible for Disaster Management Affairs, is expected to attend the burial ceremony.Last week, two people were feared dead and over 176 households were affected by floods in some parts of LilongweA vibrant writer who gives a great insight on hot topics and issuesLazarus Chakwera for permanent solutions to floods. By Jameson Chauluka:Malawi Congress Party president, Lazarus Chakwera, has called for permanent solutions to floods which wreak havoc year in, year-out in the country.Chakwera was speaking when he visited people affected by heavy downpour and floods at Nyachikadza and Mankhokwe camp Ntowe, in Nsanje District Sunday.Department of Disaster Management Affairs (Dodma) says 56 people have died and 577 injured due to the heavy downpour and subsequent floods in the Southern Region.Chakwera said Malawi has flood mitigation and adaptation plans in place but there is lack of political will from the government.“Plans are there to reduce the impact of floods in the country but they [people at the helm] want to see people suffering so that they can come with some relief items as campaign tools,” he said.Among others measures, Chakwera said the country has plans to aid Shire River follow its course during floods and to build safe houses upland where affected people can seek refuge other than being in camps.“We want people here to treat the low lying areas, which are fertile, only as business premises. Whenever the area floods, they should be in those safety homes, living with dignity and not in these camps,” he said.During the visit, Chakwera donated maize flour and pigeon peas to over 2,000 affected families in the two camps.“This is what we have bought with contributions which members of the party made but whatever the government is going to bring is what would be bought with the tax payers’ money,” he said.A vibrant writer who gives a great insight on hot topics and issuesSchools bear floods burden. The calamity which has befallen the country due to floods caused by heavy rains has affected every sector in the country. Most of the victims are seeking refuge in school blocks. But in providing such a temporary solution to the perennial problem, EMMANUEL CHIRWA has, in this Friday Shaker, established that another problem is being created—that of violeting learners’ right to education.It started with heavy rains which fell unceasingly. On March 6 2019 in the evening, a horde of villagers started off on a 16-kilometre journey to Mchenga Primary School at Ngabu in Chikwawa District.The people camped on the veranda of some classrooms at the school. They were from Traditional Authority Makhuwira in the district.Their property, including houses, had just been washed away by an overflowing Shire River. Authorities gave the villagers two classrooms to spend the night in.The next day, more people—some from as far as Group Village Head Gumbala, Nsanje District; which is on the other side of the river—sought refuge at the school.To reach the school, the villagers had to cross the flooded Shire on canoes and other vessels improvised from tree barks. Come March 9, the school was home to 1,500 people.School authorities had no choice but to accommodate the helpless people.Such was the level of desperation—the classroom’s status shifting from that of hostel at night to learning area during the day.But such goodwill had its repercussions, the school’s head teacher, Kapito Clemence, noted.“During daytime, the campers stay at the school ground with their belongings to give room to learners but, when rains come, we interrupt lessons and put learners of various grades in one classroom to accommodate the campers,” Clemence said.The school is now home to 2,000 people who share 15 toilets, thereby posing a health risk to learners as some people shun toilets.Mchenga School is not alone in this situation. Khulubvi Primary School in Thondwe, Zomba the and countless others have also been affected by the floods.Khulubvi Primary School Head teacher, Luciano Chikalimba, admitted that floods have affected teaching and learning at the school.“We conduct lessons under a tree because some of the classrooms are occupied by people affected by heavy rains. Our classes are so big that they cannot be manned by one teacher. We split them into A and B but, under the circumstances, we are forced to combine them, making it difficult to effectively deliver lessons,” he said.Chikalimba said children who are incapable of using toilets defecate in the open. This poses a health hazard to the school.Health officers distributed chemicals and gloves for use in cleaning but teaching and learning remain a challenge at the school.In the long run, such an environment undermines delivery of quality education.“Our fear is that learners are not concentrating enough when we teach them. Most get distracted while learning. Moreover, the presence of many people and other activities at the school puts off some of the learners,” Chikalimba said.Clemence said the environment prevents them from meeting the needs of each learner while some learners shun classes altogether.The Department of Disaster Management Affairs (Dodma) indicates that the country has 173 evacuation centres that accommodate victims of floods. Most of these centres are primary school rooms.Civil Society Education Coalition Executive Director, Benedicto Kondowe, said the schools that are accommodating victims are not conducive to learning.He said, as the nation is helping floods victims, it is also violating other people’s rights.“Right to education is fundamental and needs not be infringed on. We understand that the situation which the disasters have, for ages, been causing is unbearable but we ought to see to it that the right to education is not violated. When learners fail to learn because school blocks are accommodating people who have been affected by floods, this violates the learners’ right to education,” Kondowe said.Kondowe said it was high time the government and all stakeholders found long-lasting solutions to the problem of people affected by disasters lodging in schools.He said lodging in schools should be the last resort and a temporary measure.“Problems of disasters, especially those related to floods, are perennial in Malawi. What differs is just the magnitude. That being the case, the government and stakeholders should be vigilant in addressing these problems. There is need for construction of more shelters to house those affected by disasters instead of accommodating them in school,” Kondowe said.He said people that stay in flood-prone areas should adhere to the government’s call to relocate upland.He said doing so would keep the children, whose education gets disrupted in the course of running away from floods, t in school.But Education, Science and Technology Ministry’s spokesperson, Lindiwe Chide, said they have put in place measures to ensure that school lessons are not disrupted whenever floods hit the country.Chide said her ministry has collaborated with Dodma in distributing tents to schools that are accommodating flood victims.“We are distributing tents which will either be used for lessons or lodging by people affected by floods—depending on each school management’s decision,” she said.Chide said the ministry had dispatched 48 tents to schools and more are expected to be sent to all affected schools.Chide said they were not only responding to needs of schools that are accommodating flood victims but also those that had lost teaching and learning materials to the floods.“We are also sending education boxes which have textbooks and exercise books for schools and learners that have lost stationery materials to the floods,” she said.Dodma and the Ministry of Education are working hand-in-hand to distribute tents to the affected schools.Principal Secretary and Dodma Commissioner, Wilson Moleni, said some districts have received tents and the exercise is on-going.“We have distributed tents to some districts, such as Phalombe and Mulanje, to mention a few, and the exercise is on-going. We will ensure that we reach each and every centre, including areas where classes have been disrupted,” he said.“Our plan is that the government, in collaboration with international non-governmental organisations, should build more evacuation centres. Places where these structures will be erected have been earmarked. Once the project is done, the issue of flood victims being accommodated in schools will be a tale of the past,” he said.But, as of now, schools are bearing the brunt of floods.
